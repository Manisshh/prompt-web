## 2. Google AdSense Setup

To get approved for AdSense, your site needs to look "complete."

### Steps to Apply:
1. Go to [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/).
2. Add your site URL.
3. **Crucial:** Ensure you have the "Privacy Policy", "About", and "Disclaimer" pages active (included in the code above).
4. Google takes **2 to 4 weeks** for approval.
5. Once approved, copy your **Publisher ID** (e.g., `ca-pub-123...`) and replace the placeholders in `index.html` and `components/AdPlaceholder.tsx`.

### Where to Place Ads:
- **Top Banner:** High visibility, high CTR.
- **Between Input/Output:** Captures attention while users wait/work.
- **Footer:** Good for "exit" revenue.

## 3. SEO Strategy (Google Search)

### Keywords to Target:
- *Primary:* "AI Prompt Enhancer", "ChatGPT Prompt Optimizer"
- *Secondary:* "Prompt engineering tool free", "Improve AI output", "LLM prompt templates"

### How to Submit to Google Search Console:
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about).
2. Add your property (the URL Vercel gave you).
3. Verify ownership (usually via a meta tag in `index.html`).
4. Click **"URL Inspection"** and paste your homepage URL to request indexing.

## 4. Monetization & Growth

### Earnings Estimate:
- **Traffic Needed:** To earn $100/mo, you typically need ~20,000 to 40,000 monthly visitors depending on your audience's country (CPM).
- **Tip:** Post your tool on "AI Tool Directories" (Futurepedia, There's An AI For That) to get free backlinks and traffic.

### Scaling:
- **Blog:** Add a `/blog` route and write articles like "Top 10 Prompts for Marketing" to rank for more keywords.
- **Affiliate Links:** Add buttons saying "Best AI for Writing" that link to Jasper.ai or Copy.ai with your affiliate ID.

---

## Common Rejection Reasons for AdSense:
- **Insufficient Content:** Add 2-3 paragraphs of text on the "About" page.
- **No Privacy Policy:** Use the one I provided in the code!
- **Under Construction:** Ensure the "Copy" and "Enhance" buttons work perfectly before applying.
